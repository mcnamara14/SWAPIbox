# SWAPIbox
This application fetches Star Wars API data, cleans the data according to the spec then displays crawl text from a random movie on load and renders Star Wars cards with specific data attached to them according to the filter that was clicked. 

The user has the ability to select their favorite cards which they can view when clicking the "view favorites" button. If no favorites were selected a notification alerts the user. A loading gif and sound is displayed / played when a page is loading, typically due to a delay in a fetch call.
